# pointillism

[R][] package for for single-cell RNA-seq clustering analysis.

## Installation

### [R][] method

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
install.packages(
    pkgs = "pointillism",
    repos = c(
        "https://r.acidgenomics.com",
        BiocManager::repositories()
    ),
    dependencies = TRUE
)
```

### [Docker][] method

```sh
image='acidgenomics/r-packages:pointillism'
workdir='/mnt/work'
docker pull "$image"
docker run -it \
    --volume="${PWD}:${workdir}" \
    --workdir="$workdir" \
    "$image" \
    R
```

## Supported data classes

[pointillism][] currently supports these S4 single-cell container classes:

- [SingleCellExperiment][]
- [Seurat][]
- [monocle3][] `cell_data_set`

## Markers

Cell-cycle and cell-type markers are stored internally inside the package. Refer to `inst/extdata/` for the source CSV files.

## Troubleshooting

### Maximal number of DLLs reached

```
Error: package or namespace load failed for 'pointillism' in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
  maximal number of DLLs reached...
```

Depending on your operating system, you may encounter this error about hitting the DLL limit in [R][]. This issue is becoming more common as RNA-seq analysis packages grow increasingly complex. Luckily, we can configure [R][] to increase the DLL limit. Append this line to your `~/.Renviron` file:

```
R_MAX_NUM_DLLS=150
```

For more information on this issue, consult `help("dyn.load")` in the [R][] documentation. The number of loaded DLLs in an [R][] session can be obtained with `getLoadedDLLs()`.
